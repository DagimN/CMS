            <label class="q"> Q: <p> What do I do if I see a downed power line? </p> </label>
            <label class="a"> A: <p> If you see a downed line, assume it is a live power line and call EWEB 
                immediately at 1-844-484-2300. If the downed line is across a street or sidewalk, call 911. 
                There is no way to know whether it is energized, so play it safe and keep your distance—stay at least 
                50 feet (about the length of two busses) away from the...</p></label>
            
            <label class="q"> Q: <p> Why can't you tell me when my power will be restored? </p> </label>
            <label class="a"> A: <p> Unless the cause of an outage is obvious (such as a when a car runs 
                into a power pole), we don't know how long it will take to find the cause and make the repair 
                until a troubleshooter or assessment team can take a look. During widespread outages this is 
                even more challenging. After severe storms, it can take several days...</p></label> 

            <label class="q"> Q: <p>When are bills sent and then due?</p></label>
            <label class="a"> A: <p> Bills are mailed the first of the month and are due the 15th of the month. If no
                payment is received in 30 days, a shut off notice is mailed with the next month’s bill </p></label> 
            
            <label class="q"> Q: <p> How do I sign up for water and sewer service? </p></label>
            <label class="a"> A: <p> To begin water service in your name, call the billing clerk at (740) 587-1400. The
                clerk will ask your name, the property address, if you have purchased or are renting the
                property (and the landlord’s name), date to begin service, and your phone number.</p></label>

            <label class="q"> Q: <p> How much do you charge? </p></label>
            <label class="a"> A: <p> We charge as we see it fit than major telecoms companies, see our price guide for details.</p> </label>

            <label class="q"> Q: <p> Isn't it your job to fix my phone line?</p></label>
            <label class="a"> A: <p> Your service provider e.g. BT, Talk Talk Sky etc, will only maintain your phone line
                 up to the master socket within your property, all the wiring, sockets and any equipment after this, are your
                  responsibility to maintain and repair. This is where we can help.</p></label>
